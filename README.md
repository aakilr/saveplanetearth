Project Scope:
In todayâ€™s society, having a vehicle is a necessity. This poses a problem for everyone, especially UWI students and staff in terms of finding a free parking space efficiently.This Parking Management System can increase efficiency and eliminate the time spent circling a car park looking for an empty space. This application is a system which uses a sensor to deliver data to a server which can then be viewed on a frontend application by the user. It aims to report all available car parks and the user will be able to filter the parks according to the location of it.

Project Description:
This Parking Management System aims to detect and report empty parking slots to the user. This increases the efficiency of UWI students and staff in locating a car park in the various car parks of UWI (JFK, TGR, Carriri etc). This system also allows the user to choose which of the available parks would be more appropriate and suited to him/her.
