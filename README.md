# SavePlanetEarthInfo
Project Scope: Trinidad and Tobago has a significant garbage problem. Litter is widespread on this island. Disposables and other waste can be found along roadsides, in drains and even on beaches. In 2018, over a half-a-ton of garbage was removed from Invaders Bay, Port-of-Spain. Littering reveals the lack of environmental consciousness the society has. As such, Save Planet Earth aims to promote awareness to the citizens of T&T about the impact they have on the environment in a fun and creative way.
